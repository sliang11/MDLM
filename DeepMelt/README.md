# DeepMelt
This repository holds the code for our DeepMelt network for viscosity prediction, including all the code and data to generate all our experimental results.
- The experimental data is in the data folder.
- The baseline code is in the baseline folder.
- The ablation code is in the ablation folder.

You can directly run our code without any addition argument settings. For example, to run our DeepMelt network, simply use

```python DeepMelt.py```

All the required packages are in requirement.txt, which will be automatically installed upon execution of our code.


Our implementation of DeepMelt is based on the original iMelt source code (https://github.com/charlesll/i-melt), under the MIT License.

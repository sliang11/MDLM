# DeepMelt
DeepMelt is a use case for multi-mechanism scenarios in MDLM.

- The main code name of our method is DeepMelt.py. For convenience, we combined the code such as training validation and testing into a single file, the code can be run directly. Simply use

```python DeepMelt.py```

- The experimental data is in the data folder.
- The baseline code is in the baseline folder.
- The ablation code is in the ablation folder.

Our implementation of DeepMelt is based on the original iMelt source code (https://github.com/charlesll/i-melt), under the MIT License.

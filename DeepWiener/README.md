# DeepWiener
DeepWiener is a use case for single-mechanism scenarios in MDLM.

- The implementations of our model is in the `models` folder.
- Some helper codes is in the `utils` folder.
- The experimental data (train/test already splitted) is in the `Datasets` folder.

 You can directly run our code without any addition argument settings. For example, to run our Wiener network, simply use

`python experiment.py`

All the required packages are in requirement.txt.
